      "Senior **User Researcher** at the intersection of **Quantitative UX Research** and **Applied ML/LLMs**. I build evaluation-driven research and insight systems—survey classifiers, modular analysis pipelines, **vector search/RAG**, and AI-powered knowledge bases—that compress analysis and reporting from hours to minutes. Highlights: **reduced open-ended survey analysis from ~30h to under 8h**, **cut weekly survey reporting from ~4h to under 5m**, **shortened multipage document classification from ~90m to under 5m**, and **triangulated behavioral logs across 70M+ devices and a 500M+ MAU product**. Blend of peer‑reviewed research and industry impact at **Meta, Roku, Walmart,** and **Argomai**."
