    "I'm an **applied scientist and AI solutions architect** working at the intersection of **HCI** and **ML/LLMs**. I design evaluation-driven systems—**vector databases**, **retrieval pipelines**, **RAG**, reusable AI components (embeddings, prompt templates, orchestration SDK), **autonomous agents**—and pair them with rigorous mixed‑methods analytics.",
    "I've delivered measurable impact across **Meta, Roku, Walmart**, and **Argomai**: cutting multipage document classification from ~90 min to <5 min, reducing weekly reporting from 6 hrs to <1 hr, shrinking survey analysis from ~30 hrs to <8 hrs, analyzing behavioral logs over **70M+ devices**, and defining longitudinal KPIs for a **500M+ MAU** product. My north star: **rigor, practical impact, and systems that last.**",
