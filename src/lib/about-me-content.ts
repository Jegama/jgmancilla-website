    "I'm an **applied research scientist and AI solutions architect** focused on building technology that truly serves people. My work sits where **human-computer interaction** meets **machine learning/NLP**: I design evaluation-driven LLM systems (RAG pipelines, reusable component libraries, autonomous agents) and deliver insights at scale through clustering, mixed-methods analytics, and robust research ops.",
    "Across roles at **Meta, Roku, Walmart Global Tech, Stanford**, and now **Argomai**, I've led end-to-end initiativesâ€”from problem framing and study design to models, pipelines, and production rollouts. The goal is always the same: **rigorous methods, practical impact, and systems that last.**",
