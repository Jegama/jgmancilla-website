      abstract: "Este artículo explora el uso de la Inteligencia Artificial Generativa, específicamente los Grandes Modelos de Lenguaje (LLM), para analizar respuestas abiertas en evaluaciones del desempeño docente. Aunque los LLM ofrecen capacidades avanzadas para interpretar y clasificar datos textuales, su tendencia a generar \"alucinaciones\" plantea desafíos en contextos donde la precisión es crucial. Para mitigar estos riesgos, se presentan tres enfoques: los LLM de dominio específico, entrenados con datos educativos para mejorar su relevancia; los Pequeños Modelos de Lenguaje (SLM), modelos más ligeros que optimizan la eficiencia y reducen la posibilidad de errores; y el uso de modelos en la nube con entrenamiento few-shot, que permiten ajustes rápidos mediante ejemplos representativos, aunque con implicaciones en privacidad y protección de datos. Finalmente, se describen los beneficios de estas herramientas para las instituciones educativas, incluyendo la mejora en la toma de decisiones, la accesibilidad tecnológica y la sostenibilidad ecológica.",

      abstract: "Practical evaluation is crucial for improving educational quality. The blind review conducts semester surveys among students at all academic levels within the institution for a comprehensive professor performance assessment. However, processing this data manually is time-consuming and restricts in-depth analysis. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, chatbots can now accurately interpret nuanced survey responses. We propose using a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence and natural language processing, specifically large language models, to streamline survey analysis. This technology aims to quickly extract important insights, reduce staff workload, and enable informed decision-making. We are utilizing user-centered design methods to create and assess a prototype, ensuring that it meets the specific needs and characteristics of the users and provides an optimal user experience in the final product. This implementation will significantly improve operational efficiency and support continuous educational enhancement at the institution.",

      title: "Eliciting Driver Stress Using Naturalistic Driving Scenarios on Real Roads",
      authors: ["Baltodano, Sonia", "Jesus Garcia-Mancilla", "Wendy Ju"],
      publication: "Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications, pp. 298-309. ACM",
      year: "2018",
      abstract: "We propose a novel method for reliably inducing stress in drivers for the purpose of generating real-world participant data for machine learning, using both scripted in-vehicle stressor events and unscripted on-road stressors such as pedestrians and construction zones. On-road drives took place in a vehicle outfitted with an experimental display that lead drivers to believe they had prematurely ran out of charge on an isolated road. We describe the elicitation method, course design, instrumentation, data collection procedure and the post-hoc labeling of unplanned road events to illustrate how rich data about a variety of stress-related events can be elicited from study participants on-road. We validate this method with data including psychophysiological measurements, video, voice, and GPS data from (N=20) participants. Results from algorithmic psychophysiological stress analysis were validated using participant self-reports. Results of stress elicitation analysis show that our method elicited a stress-state in 89% of participants.",

      year: "2018",
      abstract: "How will pedestrians from different regions interact with an approaching autonomous vehicle? Understanding differences in pedestrian culture and responses can help inform autonomous cars how to behave appropriately in different regional contexts. We conducted a field study comparing the behavioral response of pedestrians between metropolitan Mexico City (N=113) and Colima, a smaller coastal city (N=81). We hid a driver in a car seat costume as a Wizard-of-Oz prototype to evoke pedestrian interaction behavior at a crosswalk or street. Pedestrian interactions were coded for crossing decision, crossing pathway, pacing, and observational behavior. Most distinctly, pedestrians in Mexico City kept their pace and more often crossed in front of the vehicle, while those in Colima stopped in front of the car more often.",

      publication: "International Journal of Data Science and Analytics",
      year: "2018",
      abstract: "Drawing on psychological theory, we created a new approach to classify negative sentiment tweets and presented a subset of unclassified tweets to humans for categorization. With these results, a tweet classification distribution was built to visualize how the tweets can fit in different categories. The approach developed through visualization and classification of data could be an important base to measure the efficiency of a machine classifier with psychological diagnostic criteria as the base (Thelwall et al. in J Assoc Inf Sci Technol 62(4):406–418, 2011). Nonetheless, this proposed system is used to identify red flags in at-risk population for further intervention, due to the need to be validated through therapy with an expert.",

      abstract: "New technologies are opening novel ways to help people in their decision-making while shopping. From crowd-generated customer reviews to geo-based recommendations, the information to make the decision could come from different social circles with varied degrees of expertise and knowledge. Such differences affect how much influence the information has on the shopping decisions. In this work, we aim to identify how social influence when it is mediated by modern and ubiquitous communication (such as that provided by smartphones) can affect people’s shopping experience and especially their emotions while shopping. Our results showed that large amount of information affects emotional state in costumers, which can be measured in their physiological response. Based on our results, we conclude that integrating smartphone technologies with biometric sensors can create new models of customer experience based on the emotional effects of social influence while shopping.",

      abstract: "Stress is becoming a major problem in our society and most people do not know how to cope with it. We propose a novel approach to quantify the stress level using psychophysiological measures. Using an automatic stress detector that can be implemented in a mobile application, we managed to create an alternative to automatically detect stress using sensors from a wearable device, and once it is detected, a score is calculated for each one of the records. By identifying the stress during the day and giving a numeric value from biological signals to it, a visualization could be produced to facilitate the analysis information by users.",

      abstract: "Developing new paradigms of user interaction is always challenging. The introduction of the Google Glass platform presents a novel way to deliver content to users. Clearly, the Glass platform is not going to become a mainstream consumer electronics product as it is; however it was an experimental program from which important practical lessons can be learned. We, as part of the Google Glass Explorer Community, present this study as a contribution to the practical understanding of products that can be core for the development of micro-interaction-based interfaces for wearable gadgets in urban contexts. Throughout this paper we detail the development process of this kind of application by focusing on the challenges presented, the implementation and design decisions, and the usability tests we performed. The main results were that the use of the app is intuitive in general, but the users have problems identifying several components that were adapted for the size of the screen and the concept of the device.",

      abstract: "Different approaches used to define how a website shows information have an impact on how users evaluate its usability. As shown in the present study, how people accomplish a search of visual content in a newspaper website is an important factor to review while designing it. In this study, 47 participants were randomly assigned to evaluate one of two different newspaper websites and asked to do visual and written searches. The evaluation metrics were: task success and task time. Also the participants made an overall evaluation of the site, answering two Likert questions and an open-ended question to measure qualitative aspects. Finally, we measured the overall satisfaction with a SUS questionnaire. The results show that a poor performance in the search of visual content lead to lower usability perception, this might be a main aspect to improve when defining priorities to enhance overall usability.",
