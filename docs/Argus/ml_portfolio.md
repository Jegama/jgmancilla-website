Description: To enhance customer support, I developed an **autonomous agent** using **cutting-edge AI**. This agent provides prompt, concise responses to user queries, reducing call center workload and improving self-service. Powered by technologies like **embeddings** and **OpenAI**, the system indexes all support articles from a customer support site, such as Roku's, creating a comprehensive **library catalog**. It uses embeddings to find the most relevant content and an advanced AI model to generate responses. This approach significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of our customer support, delivering **faster and more accurate solutions** to users, transforming the customer service experience.
Details: My goal was to improve customer support by introducing an **autonomous agent** capable of handling user inquiries. I aimed to create a **'Solution Spotlight'** feature that offered users clear and concise responses to their queries. This approach would reduce the workload on the call center, improve self-service, and ultimately increase customer satisfaction. This AI agent is powered by advanced ML technology, including **embeddings** and **LLMs**, and is supported by an all-encompassing index of all the articles available on a Customer Support site. This innovative approach ensures that users receive prompt, accurate, and relevant responses to their inquiries without human intervention.
Goal: Develop an autonomous agent that can provide a **'solution spotlight'**—a curated 'best answer'—to user queries., Improve customer self-service and reduce the number of calls to the call center.

## Project: Calvinist Parrot
Description: The Calvinist Parrot project, now in **version 4.0**, has been re-platformed to a production-grade Next.js/TypeScript stack with a LangChain-based multi-agent core. This evolution from a simple duet to a **‘Council-of-Three’ ensemble** uses a LangGraph state-machine for real-time streaming answers and offers seven switchable denominational ‘voices.’ These changes have reduced latency by ~40% and cut hallucinations by a third, enabling multilingual growth while keeping all features free. The new architecture features a **single RAG pipeline**, indexing a 900-book library nightly and using an autonomous agent for fetching relevant passages, resulting in a leaner, faster, and more theologically grounded system.
Details: The Calvinist Parrot project continues its mission to merge centuries-old Reformed wisdom with cutting-edge AI. Version 4.0 moves from an early Streamlit proof-of-concept to a production-grade Next.js/TypeScript stack deployed at the edge, adds LangChain-based multi-agent orchestration, widens denominational coverage, and—true to your ministry credo—keeps every feature entirely free.
Goal: Provides **faithful, Reformed-grounded** answers to biblical questions., **Democratises access**—multilingual, device-agnostic, no paywall., Continually enhance the AI's comprehension and response capabilities to foster a more profound exploration of Scriptures for users.
Solutions: 3.x → 4.0 Migration: Re-platformed to **Next.js 14** with Vercel Edge Functions (~40 % lower median latency). Introduced Prisma/PlanetScale Postgres and secure auth., Multi-Denomination Architecture: Inserts a denomination-specific prompt layer before every model call; falls back to Reformed Baptist for guests., “Council of Three” Ensemble: Fine-tuned, mini, and reviewer models cooperate, then Calvin critiques and synthesises—reducing hallucinations by roughly one-third in internal blind tests., LangGraph Workflow: Finite-state graph enforces at least one tool call, then conditionally loops until no further calls are required., Observability & Telemetry: Every message, category, and answer stored; cron jobs surface suspect answers for human review and future RLHF.
Findings: **Latency:** p95 time-to-first-token fell from 4.3 s (Streamlit) to < 2 s after edge deployment (internal logs)., **Reduction in Hallucinations:** Multiple query engines significantly reduced inaccuracies, enhancing the reliability of responses., **Enhanced User Experience:** The autonomous agent and innovative indexing algorithm provided quicker, more precise answers, enriching user interactions.

Seven “voices” you can toggle on the fly (Reformed Baptist default plus Presbyterian, Wesleyan, Lutheran, Anglican, Pentecostal/Charismatic, Non-Denominational Evangelical). Chat history and user prefs stored with Prisma/PostgreSQL for persistence and analytics., Quick QA – “Council of Three”: Four-stage pipeline: (1) question categorisation, (2) parallel answers from three specialised agents, (3) Calvin-style review, (4) synthesis of the final response. Cuts hallucinations and flags off-topic queries., LangGraph Orchestration: Autonomous agent graph refines long queries, chooses the right search tool (Bible, commentary, CCEL), and loops until no more tool calls are needed., Public API End-points: '/api/parrot-qa' and '/api/parrot-chat' expose the QA pipeline and streaming chat for third-party apps.
